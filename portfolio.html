   <h1>This is the first project we did. We created a game on Scratch about a dog trying to eat donuts in space while escaping from the dinosaur! The game gets more difficult as time goes on since the dinosaur moves a little faster every ten seconds. Try to beat your high score!</h1>

Similarly, if you indicate that you are not feeling well, the app will complement you to try and make you feel better :)</h1>
