   <h1>This is the first project we did. We created a game on Scratch about a dog trying to eat donuts in space while escaping from the dinosaur! The game gets more difficult as time goes on since the dinosaur moves a little faster every ten seconds. Try to beat your high score!</h1>

		       <h1>The App that we created is meant to neutralize your mood. If you indicate that you are feeling good at the moment, the app will insult you to try and balance your good mood. Similarly, if you indicate that you are not feeling well, the app will complement you to try and make you feel better :)</h1>
  <h1>This is the interactive story that we made. We used Python 2.7 and the website repl.it to make this interactive story. The story is about someone who is escaping from jail. You need to help them escape from prison before they are killed with the electric chair. There are 9 choices that yo need to make and if they are all correct, the prisoner will be able to escape. Don't let him get caught!</h1>
